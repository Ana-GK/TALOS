Talos

This document describes how to use the Talos robot.

Before you start

    Know that Talos is not a toy, but a very expensive piece of hardware. Therefore, procedures for working with Talos are somewhat different.
    Talos must always be tethered to the crane. Any kind of operations that involve disconnecting the crane tether are strictly forbidden!
    For now, 2 people must always be present when working with the robot - one to operate the robot and one to spot the robot during operation.
    For now, you need to obtain permission from department head to perform an experiment on the robot. He needs to OK your procedures BEFORE you start.
    Pay extra attention to the safety of the robot, we are not replacing it anytime soon.

Basics
Starting the robot

see also File:Talos handbook.pdf, page 45

    Make sure that the emergency stop button is released. Be aware there are two emergency buttons, one on the back of the robot and another tethered.
    Lift the robot so it's hanging on the crane and its feet do not touch the ground.
    Turn on the robot by flipping the power switch. Check the battery level on the indicator and connect the charger if the battery level is red (30% or less).
    Wait for a double beep (roughly 5s)
    Start the computers by pressing the PC ON button
    Check the status of the robot in the WebCommander http://talos-2c:8080 The tab diagnostics must have all green lights.

Starting default controllers

This starts the stability, walking and other demo stuff

    Make sure to spread the arms, so they are not touching the thighs!!! You will scratch the robot otherwise.
    Open a terminal and connect to the Talos control computer, password: pal

ssh pal@talos-2c

    Launch the default controllers

roslaunch talos_controller_configuration default_controllers.launch

    The robot will execute walking pose. If arm(s) stay down, see troubleshooting.

Rviz Visualization

    Open a new terminal
    Connect to the robot ros master

export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://talos-2c:11311

    Run rviz with selected configuration

rosrun rviz rviz -d ~/.rviz/demo.rviz  

Stopping the robot

    Lift the robot
    The assistant must be holding the arms, when the robot is turned off, because they will drop and potentially hit the robot.
    Turn off the PC (round button, press once)
    Wait for PC to turn off
    Turn off electronics (sqaure switch)
    Move the robot on the crane under the long rail next to the wall (otherwise crossrail will bend)
    Lower the robot, so the feet are touching the ground. The legs must be partially supporting the robot, when resting.
    Plug in the crane remote to the charger

Network Setup
Adding computer to VPN

The purpose of this is to be able to access the Talos Basestation repositories for packages and updates.

If your computer is out of the Talos network (your is IP 178.172.42.xxx) and you want to access the repos on the Basestation, you need the following setup.

    Add the user on the basestation

        root@basestation# addVpnUser -u <your_pc_hostname> -i <xxx_from_ip>
        Example:
        root@basestation# addVpnUser -u jasmin -i 102

    Change password for this user:

        root@basestation# passwd <your_pc_hostname>

    Your computer /etc/hosts file needs to have the following lines (change the basestation_public ip)

        178.172.42.151 basestation_public
        10.68.1.1 basestation
        10.68.1.1 archives.basestation

    Edit credentials file on your computer

        sudo editor /etc/openvpn/user
        The first line should be the username for the vpn user (<your_pc_hostname>), the second one should match the password for this user.

    Restart the vpn on your computer

        sudo service openvpn restart

    Check if you are on the VPN

        ifconfig
        you should see a tun0 adapter with the IP 10.68.1.xxx

    now you can use sudo apt-get update

Usage cases
Demos

Demos using position controllers

    Launching walking demo on Talos
    Drawing demo
    https://repo.ijs.si/hcr/talos/custom-moves

Demos using full body torque control:

    Launching torque controller on Talos
    Launching grasping demo on Talos
    Interactive carteasian space control on Talos

Demos using upper body only torque control:

    Launching gravity compensation mode on Talos
    Launching impedance controllers on Talos


(Re)playing joint trajectories

Use https://github.com/pal-robotics/play_motion

Example:

rosrun play_motion play_motion 
rosrun play_motion run_motion wave
rosrun actionlib axclient.py /play_motion

Vision

    See Using the Talos RGBD stack

Safety

    Joint limit safety is only enabled when using WBC in the real robot, not in simulation.
    Self-collision safety is only supported in the kinematic WBC and not with dynamic WBC. [1]

Troubleshooting
Red light in diagnostics

    Go to the WebCommander http://talos-2c:8080to the startup tab.
    Stop deployer
    Stop ros_bringup
    Start ros_bringup
    Start deployer
    They must be green otherwise start again
    Diagnostics should be all green now, if not do complete startup.

Arm(s) stay down when starting default controllers

Execute walking pose
Basestation is unreachable

Someone else is probably using the same IP as you. Try sudo service openvpn restart.
Controllers stopped, motor error on all links

Probably some safety violation occurred. Check using: pal-log deployer cat and guide the robot to a safe configuration.

Then you can restart key ros components using the following sequence

pal-stop deployer && pal-stop ros_bringup && pal-start ros_bringup && pal-start deployer

Finally run the default controllers to check if everything is ok, before starting any other controller.
ethernet link is down on the robot

You probably restarted the deployer while having the emergency button pressed.

Find out process ids of deployer using ps -aux | grep deployer and then stop each of them using kill -9 ID.

You can kill all processes at once: ps -aux | grep deployer | awk '{print $2}' | head -4 | xargs kill -9
WebCommander is not reachable

Try to connect to the robot using direct connection between development computer and the robot. WebCommander address is in this case http://10.68.0.1:8080/. If this works, check following:

    whether wireless connection works
    whether tun0 interface is enabled (if not, this means that the VPN is down)
    whether system time is correct (VPN connection won't work if the certificate in /etc/openvpn/client.crt is not yet valid or expired)

In the later case, a temporary workaround is:

    Establish ssh connection ssh pal@10.68.0.1 or ssh pal@talos-2m and then ssh talos-2c from within talos-2m
    Change date using sudo date -s "May 25 2020 11:32:00" (or whatever time between July 2017 and June 2037)
    Restart VPN sudo service openvpn restart
    Restart NTP sudo service ntp restart (to sync the time with basestation)
    Now WebCommander should be reachable through http://talos-2c:8080/ as usual
