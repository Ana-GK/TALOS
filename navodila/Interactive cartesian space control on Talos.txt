Interactive carteasian space control on Talos

If you want to control the real robot in cartesian space:

    Launch the robot in the dynamical mode
        Start default controllers
        Stop default controllers once the robot is in the right position
        Start torque control
    Execute: rosrun pal_locomotion StartWBCAction

And then open a new terminal pointing to the robot (export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://talos-2c:11311) and execute:

If you want to control it using interactive markers:

roslaunch talos_wbc interactive_markers.launch ns:=/biped_walking_dcm_controller/wbc
rviz -d ~/.rviz/marker_demo.rviz


If you want to control it by rostopic:

roslaunch talos_wbc interactive_markers.launch ns:=/biped_walking_dcm_controller/wbc source_data:=topic_reflexx_typeII

You will be able to modify the desired pose of the end effectors by publishing on the following topics:

/biped_walking_dcm_controller/wbc/gripper_left_base_link_goal
/biped_walking_dcm_controller/wbc/gripper_right_base_link_goal

As always, please have the emergency button ready for security.
